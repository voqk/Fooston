Following the first serve of a match, subsequent serves shall be made by the team last scored upon. The first serve in
subsequent games of a multi-game match shall be made by the team that lost the preceding game.

## 5.1

If the ball is served by the wrong team, and the violation is discovered before the ball is scored, play shall be stopped and the ball shall be served by the proper team. Once the ball is scored, no protests shall be allowed, and play shall continue as if no infraction had been committed.

## 5.2

If a team is awarded possession because the opposing team is penalized for a rules infraction and the ball subsequently goes dead between the five-man rods it shall be served by the team who originally served that ball.
