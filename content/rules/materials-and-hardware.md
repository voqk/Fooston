## Table

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The Official tables are voted by ITSF General Assembly. This choice of table can be modified according to the agreements between the ITSF and manufacturers and partners.
  </li>
  <li>
    The organizers must provide competitive equipment (sandpapered players, clean and straight bars).
  </li>
  <li>
    In no cases may the surface of the table be sandpapered, and doing so will be penalized by exclusion of the tournament and reimbursement of the surface.
  </li>
  <li>
    Players are free to lubricate the exterior of the bars. Not interior in case of telescopic bars.
  </li>
  <li>
    The organizers may make it compulsory to utilize specific brands of lubrication products and cleaning agents. These must then be made accessible to the Players. Under these circumstances, the use of another brand will result in exclusion of the Player from the tournament.
  </li>
  <li>
    Applying resin, magnesium, or any similar product, directly onto the table surface or balls is strictly prohibited. The penalty for violation may be grounds for exclusion of the player from the tournament.
  </li>
  <li>
    The organizers are free to prohibit any products considered to be dangerous for the equipment or for the Players.
  </li>
  <li>
    No changes may be made to affect the interior playing characteristics of the table or men with the exception of routine table maintenance.
  </li>
</ol>

## Balls

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The Official balls are voted by ITSF sport commission. An appendix to this rule will be provided after the final choice for the season has been made.
  </li>
  <li>
    During competition, games must be played with balls provided at the tournament site.
  </li>
  <li>
    All Players are required to obtain an approved tournament ball.
  </li>
</ol>

## Handles

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Each Player may use the handles of his choice on tables where handles can be changed. They must be able to fit onto the bars without causing damage to the table or injury to the player.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Players movements must be unassisted and unobstructed. No mechanical systems will be authorized. The handles must be securely attached to the bar on which they are installed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The organizers may rule that specific handles are dangerous and therefore require that the Player not use them. Refusal by a Player to remove his handles will lead to exclusion from the tournament.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a multiple game match players must be able to change the handles within the time allotted between games, time outs or between points.
  </li>
</ol>

## Other Accessories

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    All other accessories (gloves, elastic bands, no-skid handle-sleeves...) are authorized unless they are perceived to endanger the Player or other participants.
  </li>
  <li>
    Under no circumstances may the surface or sides of the table be modified by the accessories.
  </li>
</ol>
