[official ruleset](https://www.table-soccer.org/rules/documents/2016_Rulebook.pdf) 

This latest revision of the ITSF Rule Book is the culmination of a collaborative effort with input from many players and referees from around the world under the direction of the ITSF Rules Commission. Changes have been made to simplify some rules, to clarify others, and to make it easier for referees to officiate matches. Players are encouraged to learn and study these rules so that, regardless of one’s nationality or table preference, all may compete fairly according to the same standards of play. The Rules Commission will continue to monitor how well these rules are working and will modify them as needed based on feedback from the players and referees.

Sincerely,

Tom Yore, President

ITSF Rules Commission
